            <h2>About Hailey</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Hailey Tran! I'm currently a senior at the University of California San Diego and I am 
                    majoring in Mathematics Computer Science & minoring in Sociology. I graduate at the end of Summer of 2022.
                    I plan on diving directly into the tech industry post-grad! More specifically, I'm very interested in web-development 
                    and front-end development. Academics aside, I'm from Los Angeles, CA! I love hiking when it's not too hot out!
                    One of my goals is to participate in a marathon! I also really enjoy baking, I find it to be a great destresser!
